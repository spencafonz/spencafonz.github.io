    <h1>My Story </h1>
    
    <p class="center"> 
        On December 13th, 2007 my life was changed. My day started normally with a bagel and orange juice. I had no idea what was going to happen. I heard a train like noise outside and thought it was a tornado until I heard a gargling sound. What happened next changed my life forever. <br>
        
    </p>

    <p class="center"> 
        While seeking shelter in my bathroom, a bright white light looking portal appeared. All of a sudden it seemed like I was going light speed to another planet. Before I knew it, I was in an entirely different place observing another being of some sort. There were two geometric looking species also observing me. I had no concept of space or where I was. <br>
    </p>

    <p class="center"> 
       The other beings did nothing but observe me as I was observing them. They seemed harmless and curious. After what seemed to only be 10 minutes, the same lightspeed seeming travel commenced. I was back in my bathroom untouched. I will never forget it.<br>
